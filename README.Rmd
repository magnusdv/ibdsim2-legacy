# Legacy version of the ***ibdsim2*** online app

This repository hosts the legacy version of the Shiny frontend for the R package [ibdsim2](https://github.com/magnusdv/ibdsim2). It is preserved for reference only and should not be used in new projects.

## Access the legacy app
The legacy version is available here: <https://magnusdv.shinyapps.io/ibdsim2-legacy>.

## New version
The legacy app was based on version 1.4.0 of **ibdsim2**. Since then, this package has undergone a thorough update, resulting in much faster simulations and several new features. This required a substantial rewrite of the Shiny app, which was re-launched as part of **ibdsim2** version 2.1.0. Due to breaking changes in the underlying implementation, slightly different output can be expected in the new version compared to the legacy app.

Access the new app here: <https://magnusdv.shinyapps.io/ibdsim2-shiny>.
