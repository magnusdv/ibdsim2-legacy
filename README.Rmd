# A Shiny App for **ibdsim2** - Legacy Version

This repository hosts the legacy version of the Shiny frontend for the R package **ibdsim2**. It is preserved for reference only and should not be used in new projects.

## Access the Legacy App
Try the legacy app here: <https://magnusdv.shinyapps.io/ibdsim2-legacy>.

## New Version
The legacy app was based on version 1.4.0 of **ibdsim2**. Since then, this package has undergone a thorough update, resulting in much faster simulations and several new features. This required a substantial rewrite of the Shiny app, which was re-launched as part of **ibdsim2** version 2.1.0. Due to breaking changes in the underlying implementation, slightly different output can be expected in the new version compared to the legacy app.

The new app can be accessed here: <https://magnusdv.shinyapps.io/ibdsim2-shiny>.
